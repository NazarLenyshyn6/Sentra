"""
This module defines the `EdaPipeline`, which represents a structured sequence
of exploratory data analysis (EDA) stages for tabular datasets.

Each stage in the pipeline encapsulates a well-defined task such as handling
missing values or analyzing cardinality. Each task is supported by a set of
prompt-driven strategies designed to guide LLM-based code generation in a
modular and explainable way.

This structure allows for composable, transparent, and extensible EDA workflows
that can be dynamically adapted to user queries or dataset characteristics.
