"""
This module defines an asynchronous tool for AI agents to introspect the available stages
within selected pipelines in the Prompt Engine.

Agents must call this tool *after selecting the most relevant pipelines* in order to:
- Understand the logical structure of those pipelines.
- Determine which stages are needed to solve the userâ€™s question.
- Prepare for selecting strategies within those stages.
