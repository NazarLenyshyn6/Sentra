"""
This module defines an asynchronous tool for AI agents to introspect the available strategies
within selected stages of a pipeline.

Agents must call this tool *after selecting the most relevant stages*. It returns all available
fine-grained logic units (strategies) within those stages, allowing the agent to choose the exact
building blocks needed to construct the final dynamic prompt.
